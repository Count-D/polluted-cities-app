# About

This is a Website I did from wireframing, designing through coding and problem solving until the final touch with animations and styling.

## Basic Idea

Basic Idea was to make a Website with google maps api that will show information from data file in a separate component and making it a little interactive and educational. So, when you Click on a marker you will be provided with the info about the City.

## Building

In Planning, The biggest problem to face was connecting the data file with google maps api and it's markers and show it in a separate component. After a lot of research and experimentation I came up to use Redux,
A Great tool for storing states and dispatching it to whatever component is needed.
